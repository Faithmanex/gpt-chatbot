# Chatbot UI

This project is a simple HTML and CSS chatbot user interface (UI) that can be used to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The UI allows users to enter messages and receive responses from the chatbot in a conversation-like format.

## Getting Started

To use this chatbot UI, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for an API key on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

Once you have an API key, you can clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will need to enter your API key in the input field provided on the UI.

## Usage

To use the chatbot UI, simply enter a message in the input field and press the "Send" button or hit the Enter key. The chatbot will respond with a message that appears below the input field.
